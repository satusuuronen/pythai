archon
==========================================================================
Archon is a part of the Pythai artificial intellegence project written with Python. The ultimate goal is yet
unclear but it will hopefully clarify at some point :) Currently it contains
a basic genetic programming library and a nice car game that utilies genetic programming. 
A second game called Archon has been already added with a Javascript GUI
(thanks to satusuuronen) but it doesn't yet use genetic programming.
